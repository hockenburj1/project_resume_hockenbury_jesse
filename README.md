### Syntax Highlighter

Syntax Highlighter is a jQuery plugin that tranforms code blocks on a website in to rich, colorful, easy to read code examples.

I used this plugin at the bottom of my page to provide a code block with a function thanking the viewer for visiting.

### Google Map Integration

Gmaps is a library that extends and simplifies the existing Google Maps API provided by Google.

I use this plugin to provide an interactive map of where I am located and allows users to move the map around and see the surrounding area. 

### Custom
The custom jQuery functionality I implemented was on the profile picture. Upon mouseover or mouseout the profile picture will change in opacity from 100% to 50%. While not a major UI element can definitely adda nice touch for those who do mouseover the profile picture.

## Comments
Throughout this project I attempted to incorporate color and style features from my other branding materials including my physical resume.

With each project I am moving towards using less and less media queries by further utilizing the mobile-first design and coding strategy.
